# Refactored Code and Component Organization

### Overview

Hey MoonDevs,

In accordance with the project requirements, I've cleaned up the code to make it easier to read and work with. I moved things around in the folders so it's simpler to find stuff.

### Folder Structure

I've organized the code into separate folders for different types of parts. This makes things neater and helps you find what you need faster. For example, if you're looking for the BurnSection part, just go to the "burn section" folder and you'll find it there.

### Benefits

##### This rearrangement helps in a few ways:

- Easier to Read: Now the code is arranged in a clear way, so it's simpler for developers to understand and find what they're looking for.

- Easier to Update: By separating components into their own folders, it's easier to make changes later without causing problems.

- Faster Development: Developers can quickly find and work on specific parts without getting lost in a big folder mess.

### Conclusion
I've tried my best to clean up the code and make it easier for us to work with in the future. Thanks for letting me work on this and make the project better.

Thanks, <br />
